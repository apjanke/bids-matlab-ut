These are the cue-based hand & tongue movement data described in the Journal of Neuroscience 2007 Manuscript titled: “Spectral Changes in Cortical Surface Potentials during Motor Movement”. The patients only partially overlap with the patients from that study.Please keep in mind that these anonymized data are from real patients who donated time in a difficult period of their lives to advance our understanding of the brain. Any publication involving these data MUST include the following in the methods section of the manuscript, without modification: Ethics statement: All patients participated in a purely voluntary manner, after providing informed written consent, under experimental protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Washington (#12193). All patient data was anonymized according to IRB protocol, in accordance with HIPAA mandate. It was made available through the XXXXName of database/manuscriptXXX repository [insert citation here], freely available at XXXURL. All patient data was anonymized according to IRB protocol, in accordance with HIPAA mandate. These data originally appeared in the manuscript “Spectral Changes in Cortical Surface Potentials during Motor Movement” published in Journal of Neuroscience in 2007 [Insert Embedded Citation for the Manuscript Here – e.g. Endnote, BibTex].
