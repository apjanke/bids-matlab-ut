# bids-examples

This repository contains a set of [BIDS-compatible](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/)
datasets with **empty raw data files**. These datasets can be useful to:

1. write lightweight software tests
1. serve as an example on how a BIDS dataset can be structured

ALL RAW DATA FILES IN THIS REPOSITORY ARE EMPTY!

However for some of the data, the headers containing the metadata are still
intact. This is true for the following datasets:

- `synthetic`
- Most EEG or iEEG data in BrainVision format (e.g., `eeg_matchingpennies`)

# Contributing

If you want to contribute a dataset to the examples, we would be happy to
accommodate it, as long as it exhibits some structure or particularity that is
not covered by the examples that are already present so far.

For more information, see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file.
