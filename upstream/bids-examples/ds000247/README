DESCRIPTION

# Experiment

    - 5 subjects x 5 minute resting sessions, eyes open 


# MEG acquisition

    - Acquisition at 2400Hz, with a CTF 275 MEG system,
    - Recorded at the Montreal Neurological Institute in 2012-2016.
    - Anti-aliasing low-pass filter at 600Hz, files may be saved with or without the CTF 3rd order gradient compensation.
    - Recorded channels (at least 297):
        * 26 MEG reference sensors (#2-#27)
        * 270 MEG axial gradiometers (#28-#297)
        * 1 ECG bipolar (EEG057/#298) - Not available in the empty room recordings
        * 1 vertical EOG bipolar (EEG058/#299) - Not available in the empty room recordings
        * 1 horizontal EOG bipolar (EEG059/#300) - Not available in the empty room recordings 
  

# Head shape and fiducial points

    - 3D digitization using a Polhemus Fastrak device driven by Brainstorm. The .pos files contain:
        * The center of the CTF coils,
        * The anatomical references we use in Brainstorm: nasion and ears as illustrated here,
	* Around 100 head points distributed on the hard parts of the head (no soft tissues). 


# Subject anatomy

    - Structural T1 image (defaced for anonymization purposes)
    - Processed with FreeSurfer 5.3
    - The anatomical fiducials (NAS, LPA, RPA) have already been marked and saved in the files fiducials.m 




The data in this dataset has been organized according to the BIDS specifications (Brain Imaging Data Structure, http://bids.neuroimaging.io)

General Comments
----------------


Defacing
--------
Pydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure de-identification of subjects. The code
can be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface
mri_deface was used on all T1.mgz images located in derivatives. Learn more about it here:

Quality Control
---------------
MRIQC could not be run on this dataset. It will be included in a future revision.
